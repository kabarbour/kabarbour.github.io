### **Project Overview**

This interactive site explores how climate change is already affecting the Midwest — through rising temperatures, longer heatwaves, and increasing health risks. Built in R Markdown with data from the World Resources Institute, it shows how a global crisis is playing out in local, everyday ways.

### **The Question**

How do you convince Midwesterners — especially those who don’t see themselves in national climate coverage — that climate change is already impacting them? This project uses personal context and localized data to make the case.

### **Audience & Format**

Designed for skeptical or unsure Midwestern adults, the project centers on 11 cities across the region. Key metrics include:

- Days above 95°F
- Heatwave duration and frequency
- Wet bulb temperatures
- Drought risk

Charts are paired with news stories and calendar-style visuals to ground abstract data in lived experience.

### **Key Insights**

- All cities are projected to see more extreme heat, with some expected to double their number of very hot days
- Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and longer-lasting
- Health risks — especially for older adults — are already visible in local ER data


### **Reflection**

This project reinforced that data storytelling works best when it’s grounded in what people know and feel. I’d love to expand it with interactive tools, add equity-focused layers, and improve the design to better connect with everyday users.
