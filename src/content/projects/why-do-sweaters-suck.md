### **Project Overview**

This project explores why so many sweaters today feel cheap and fall apart fast. Built as a mobile-friendly Figma prototype, it walks users through the rise of synthetic fabrics like polyester and gives practical tips for finding sweaters that last — even on a budget.

### **The Question**

What’s changed in sweater production, and how can shoppers avoid the worst of it? The piece blends fiber production data, fast fashion context, and a buyer’s guide to help users shop smarter.

### **Audience & Format**

Designed for budget-conscious 20-somethings frustrated by fast fashion, the piece is structured like a swipeable shopping guide. Visuals include:

- Global rise in synthetic fiber use
- Breakdowns of natural vs synthetic materials
- Tips for identifying better sweaters (by label and feel)

### **Key Insights**

- Synthetic materials like polyester now dominate fiber production
- Many sweaters labeled as “wool” are mostly plastic
- Better options exist — especially secondhand — but users need help knowing what to look for

### **Reflection**

The biggest challenge was keeping the tone clear and helpful while still showing meaningful data. I’d love to expand this into a full site with a shopping tool or material glossary, but this project already helped demystify a common frustration.
